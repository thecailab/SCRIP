\usage{
SCRIPsimTrueCounts(sim, params)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{SingleCellExperiment to add true counts to.}

\item{params}{SplatParams object with simulation parameters.}
}
\value{
SingleCellExperiment with simulated true counts.
}
\description{
Simulate a true counts matrix. Counts are simulated from a poisson
distribution where Each gene in each cell has it's own mean based on the
group (or path position), expected library size and BCV.
