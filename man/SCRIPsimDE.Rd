\title{Simulate group differential expression}
\usage{
SCRIPsimGroupDE(sim, params)

SCRIPsimPathDE(sim, params)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{SingleCellExperiment to add differential expression to.}

\item{params}{splatParams object with simulation parameters.}
}
\value{
SingleCellExperiment with simulated differential expression.
}
\description{
Simulate differential expression. Differential expression factors for each
group are produced using getLNormFactors and these are added
along with updated means for each group. For paths care is taken to make sure
they are simulated in the correct order.
